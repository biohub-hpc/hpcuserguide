# Connecting with Open OnDemand

## Overview
Each site's resources are made available via [Open
OnDemand](https://openondemand.org/). The [Open
OnDemand](https://openondemand.org/) interface provides a graphical, web-based
entry point to access the cluster resources. 

In addition to providing a web based terminal and shell environment, similar to
using `ssh` to connect, it also provides graphical tools for managing
files/data and submitting jobs. However, the most powerful features of [Open
OnDemand](https://openondemand.org/) are the site applications added to it. The
list of available applications will grow over time, if there's something you'd
like to see there please request it.
