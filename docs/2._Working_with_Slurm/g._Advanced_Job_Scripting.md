# Advanced Job Scripts

## Traps

Linux processes can send signals to and receive signals from other processes.
When using the `kill` command to end a running process, you are sending it
a signal. By default `kill` sends the signal 15, also known as `SIGTERM`,
which asks the process politely to stop running. `kill -9 PID` kills the
process without allowing it to process any other signals, 9 is also known as
`SIGKILL`. You can find more information about the available signals with `man
7 signal`.

All processes have the option of capturing these signals with a trap and
handling the trap with some routine that runs for a given signal. Try the
following example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

trap "echo -e '\n\nHi $USER, I caught a signal\n\n'" SIGINT SIGTERM

echo "I am PID: $$"
echo

sleep 3600
```

Save that as a file, make it executable with `chmod a+x main.sh` and execute
it, once running press CTRL-C. CTRL-C sends the process the SIGINT signal,
which the script has specified in the trap. The result is that the process is
killed, but executes the trap prior to ending:

```bash
[user@host ~]$ ./trap.sh
I am PID: 31389

^C

Hi user, I caught a signal


[user@host ~]$
```
 
### Use in Job Scripts

There are numerous ways in which signals can be useful in a job script, which
include but are not limited to:

- Cleaning up when the job exits, regardless of how it exits.
- Reporting progress from the job script.

The most common way to use traps is to handle job cleanup. If the job is killed
for exceeding time limits, exceeding memory, or for any other reason, Slurm
will first send it `SIGINT`, then wait for a short time before sending
`SIGKILL` to clean up any lingering processes. Between getting those signals, a
trap can perform functions like copying partial results, deleting temp files,
removing partial results to prepare for the job being requeued, etc. The
following example shows how a trap can be used to clean up temp files on job
exit, using the trap special keyword `EXIT` which causes the trap to run when
the script exits. As a bonus, it demonstrates the use of `mktemp` to create
unique temporary files.


```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --time=2:00:00
#SBATCH --job-name=TRAPS
#SBATCH --nodes=1

function cleanup () {
  rm -f ${mytempfile}
  echo "Cleanup Completed."
}

trap cleanup EXIT

echo "I am PID: $$"
echo

mytempfile=$(mktemp /tmp/username.XXX)

echo "My temp file is ${mytempfile}"
echo
ls ${mytempfile}
sleep 300
```

And when executed:

```bash
# Submit our trap enabled job.
[user@host ~]$ sbatch traps.sh
Submitted batch job 7243
```

```
# It's running!
[user@host ~]$ squeue -u $USER
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
              7243     batch    TRAPS username  R       0:03      1 nodename
```

```bash
# ssh to node, see temp file.
[user@host ~]$ ssh nodename ls /tmp/username*
/tmp/username.nXg
```

```bash
# Wait for job to complete, check again. No temp file.
[user@host ~]$ ssh nodename ls /tmp/username*
```

```bash
# See what our output looks like.
[user@host ~]$ cat slurm-7243.out
I am PID: 50662

My temp file is /tmp/username.nXg

/tmp/username.nXg
Cleanup Completed.
```
