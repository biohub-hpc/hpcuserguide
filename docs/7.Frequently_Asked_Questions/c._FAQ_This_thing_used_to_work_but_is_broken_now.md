# `${THING}` used to work, broken now.

When something that was working, stops working, here are some of the common things to look for:

* Has anything been added to your `${HOME}/.bashrc` or `${HOME}/.bash_profile`?
* Have you,possibly inadvertently, installed something into `${HOME}/.local` which causes a conflict in binaries or libraries?
* Are you hitting a quota or full disk issue? 
* Has your input data or parameters changed? Now using a larger data set, for instance.
* Have you tested from an incognito browser window and/or flushed the browser cache?

If none of those things seem to be the issues, reach out to us for additional help troubleshooting.
