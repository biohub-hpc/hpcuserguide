## How?

### [`#hpc-community` Slack channel](https://czbiohub.slack.com/archives/C02CF73PLC8) 

The primary and recommended method to request help with the CZBiohub HPC
environment is the [`#hpc-community` Slack
channel](https://czbiohub.slack.com/archives/C02CF73PLC8). `#hpc-community` is
where news about the environment will be posted, and it is hoped that this
forum will become a hub where people using the HPC enviornment can exchange
ideas and suggestions, request enhancements, discuss changes and share
computational success stories.

### Primary Sysadmin: `@griznog`

You can reach out to the sysadmin by:

 * Slack direct message to `@griznog` 
 * email to [john.hanks@czbiohub.org](mailto:john.hanks@czbiohub.org).

## When?

If any of the following apply:

 * Something doesn't work or seems broken. 
 * Something seems difficult or impossible to accomplish. 
 * Something seems abnormally slow or abnormally fast.
 * You have an idea to improve the environment.
 * You need a software package added to the environment.
 * You just want to talk about computational science or computing in general.

The HPC Environment exists to serve the needs of the CZBioHub community. We
can't do that unless you tell us what those needs are and keep us up to date on
how things are working for you. This is a collaborative service in which you,
via requests and feedback, are very much the driver of the design and
operation. Please contact us early and often.
