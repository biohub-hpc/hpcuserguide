# HPC User Guide

Welcome to the CZBioHub HPC User Guide, a reference for all things in the
CZBioHub HPC universe available for Scientific and Research Computation,
Storage and Networking.

This documentation is divided into several sections, accessible via the left hand sidebar.

## HPC Systems

CZBioHub has several HPC systems available at each site for scientific computing. Please
refer to [Hardware](computing_environment/hardware/overview.md) page for more information.

We have several PBs of storage using VAST, GPFS and Lustre filesystems which are Parallel File System
used in HPC environments. Please refer to [Storage](computing_environment/storage/overview.md) page for more information.

## Software Stack

We have a centrally managed software stack that is available on all the HPC systems. Currently, we use [Lmod](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as the 
module system. To learn more about how to use Lmod, please refer to our [Lmod](environment/lmod.md) page. For a complete list
of software you can check out the [Software List](software/software_modules.md).

An in-depth look at the centrally managed Software Stack and Operating System
installed applications of interest and details about how to effectively
self-manage user and group installed software.
