# Operating System

The HPC environment is built on [Rocky Linux 8](https://rockylinux.org/) as the
base operating system. A full suite of OS supplied software is installed,
including most expected Linux/Unix tools, several desktop environments, Office
and Internet applications and development libraries and tools. Where there is
an option to install a package using a supported RPM for [Rocky Linux
8](https://rockylinux.org/), this is the preferred way to get the application
into the cluster environment.
