# Overview

The cluster software environment consists of three basic categories of
software/applications/tools, these are:

1. Operating System installed packages.
2. `module` managed applications and tools.
3. A list of our managed applications and tools.
4. Best practices for using our managed `conda` module.
5. Information on installing self-managed software installations.


Each of these will be covered in more detail n the next chapters.

If you need an application added to the cluster environment, please [Contact
