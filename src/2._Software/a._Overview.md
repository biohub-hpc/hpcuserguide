# Overview

The cluster software environment consists of three basic categories of
software/applications/tools, these are:

1. Operating System installed packages.
1. `module` managed applications and tools.
1. Self-managed software installations.

Each of these will be covered in more detail n the next chapters.

If you need an application added to the cluster environment, please [Contact

possible using the best method for the given request.
